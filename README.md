# DB Connector Package

This Python package (`dbconnector`) provides a convenient way to connect to Teradata and Oracle databases. It includes error handling and uses SQLAlchemy for Oracle connections.

## Installation

You can install the package using `pip`. Make sure you have Python and `pip` installed on your system.

```bash
pip install dbconnector
```

Make sure to replace the placeholder values (your_teradata_username, your_teradata_password, your_oracle_username, your_oracle_password, localhost, 1521, ORCL) with your actual database credentials and connection details.

Feel free to customize the connection strings and adjust the code according to your specific requirements.

Note
Ensure that your system has the necessary database drivers installed for Teradata and Oracle connections.
If you encounter any issues during installation or usage, check the error messages and verify your database credentials and connection details.
Happy coding!
